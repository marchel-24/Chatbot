# Quick Recipe Finder Bot

A rule-based Discord chatbot that helps users find simple recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand.

## Background: The Problem This Bot Solves

In a world full of complex recipe websites and cooking shows, deciding what to make for dinner can lead to "analysis paralysis." Many people have a few ingredients in their fridge but lack the inspiration to combine them into a simple meal.

The *Quick Recipe Finder Bot* solves this by providing immediate, simple recipe suggestions. It cuts through the noise of detailed, multi-step recipes and empowers users to quickly create a meal with what they already have, reducing food waste and decision fatigue.

## Features

-   *Ingredient-Based Suggestions*: Finds recipes by matching the ingredients you list.
-   *Regex-Powered*: Uses regular expressions for flexible and powerful matching.
-   *Pronoun Reflection*: Engages in simple, natural conversation (e.g., "I have..." -> "You have...").
-   *Simple & Fast*: Designed to give you a meal idea in seconds.
-   *Discord Integration*: Easy to add to any Discord server.
